## A Feral Cat Counting App

This is my take on a Scrimba intro JS project - a counter for feral cat TNR programs. I learned a lot about implementing, incrementing, and storing counts in Javascript.

TRN stands for "Trap Neuter and Return" and refers to community programs for humanely reducing feral cat populations over time. The idea is that volunteers could use this simple interactive app on their phones to record cats as they are trapped and get an idea of how many cats in the neighborhood have gone through the program in a given period of time.
